# Data Mining and Analysis

This repository contains coursework completed for DSC 441: Fundamentals of Data Science. Each folder includes a structured assignment focused on key topics such as data preprocessing, data mining techniques, predictive modeling, and machine learning using R. Assignments cover a range of tasks including clustering, classification (e.g., SVM, decision trees), normalization techniques, exploratory data analysis, and rule-based modeling. Where applicable, source datasets and R scripts are included to demonstrate practical implementations of the concepts.
